    <h2>Fantasy Track Wiki</h2>
     <p>This wiki aims at providing a simple, yet complete guide on how the Fantasy Track app works. I hope you are enjoying the app! Check back often as this guide is constantly being updated.</p>
    <p><strong>League Creation</strong></p>
    <p>Create a league through the sidebar or from the home screen. You will be asked for a league name, your desired team name, a draft time, and a school or other Athletic.net team. The school you select is permanent, but the other fields can be edited later.
      Once your league is created, you may invite people using the 6-character league code provided on your league's dashboard. Once your league is created, you (the league owner) will be unable to delete it. However, owners that have joined it are able to leave before the draft starts.</p>
    <p><strong>Rosters</strong></p>
    <p>Each team roster has the following position limits:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>2 Sprinters</li>
      <li>2 Distance Runners</li>
      <li>2 Field Athletes</li>
      <li>3 Substitutes/Bench</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>The Draft</strong></p>
    <p>When you choose a draft time, all players must join the league at least 5 minutes before the set time. This is to allow time where owners can get ready and wait in the draft room. Consequently, all changes to the draft time must occur at least 5 minutes before its current time.
      Owners will receive a push notification 5 minutes before as well. The draft uses a snake rotation, where the order flips every round. There will be 9 rounds for all leagues, so that teams are full at the end. There is no trading or dropping athletes during the draft.
      You may join the draft room 5 minutes early, or when it shows on your league's dashboard. When it is your turn, a notification sound will be played. Don't forget to setup your roster as you draft, and don't forget about position limits.
      At anytime during the draft you may view another team's roster by navigating to the pick order tab and tapping on their name. Athletes can be filtered by position/event and you can choose to view only free agents (non-drafted athletes). If at any time you leave the draft, you may return via the league dashboard.
