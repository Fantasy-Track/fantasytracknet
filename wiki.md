# Fantasy Track Wiki!

Welcome to the Fantasy Track wiki! Here you can learn everything about Fantasy Track. This page will be updated often to best provided updated details of how the app works.

# Getting Started
When you first open the app, you will need to either create your own league and invite your friends, or join someone else's league.

## Creating and Managing a League

Create a league through the sidebar or from the home screen. You will be asked for a league name, your desired team name, a draft time, and a school or other Athletic.net team. The school you select is permanent, but the other fields can be edited later. Once your league is created, you may invite people using the 6-character league code provided on your league's dashboard.

### Projections and Primary Events
It may take a few minutes after creating a league before the projections are fully calculated and before the athletes have any listed primary events. New athletes will only have any event or projection information.

### Leave a League
Anyone except the league manager may leave the league. Got to settings and press *Team Settings* and then *Delete Team*.

### Edit League Settings

You can edit the maximum number of teams, draft time, draft turn duration, and the name of the league in the *League Settings*.

### Kicking Teams

The League Manager may kick teams from their league in the *League Settings*.

# The Draft
Draft rooms open **5 minutes** before the specified drafting time. All teams must join before then. Every league will draft in a snake rotation, and the pick time can be configured by the League Manager before the draft in the *League Settings*.

# Meets and Results
Rosters lock at **12am PST** before the meets. This will create a copy of your roster of this meet, which you may view by tapping the left arrow near the top of the roster page. Any changes made to your roster on/after the day of the meet will only affect future meets. When results are posted on Athletic.net, it may take some time before the results are scored and appear in the *Meets* tab of your league or on the *League Dashboard*.

# Trading
To view your trades, navigate to the *Trade Proposals* Screen from your roster page.  Additionally, you can access this screen through a notification on your league dashboard when you have pending/processing trades. You can then view your pending, completed (accepted/rejected), and cancelled trades, as well as all accepted trades in your league.

### Proposing a Trade
To propose a trade, either navigate to a team's roster and press the *Propose Trade* button or go to an athlete's profile page and press *Trade*. You must select an equal number of athletes to receive and offer.

### Accepting/Rejecting/Cancelling a Trade
If you tap on a card in the *Trade Proposals* Screen, it will show you a more detailed overview of the trade, and you will have the option to accept, reject, or cancel the trade. Only pending trades can be cancelled. After accepting a trade, it will be processed within the next hour and the **athletes will be added to your bench**.

### Trade Invalidation
If you drop or trade an athlete that is involved in another trade (pending or processing), the trade will be cancelled.
